A Machine Learning project on Calories Burnt by exercises 
### Calories Burnt Prediction Project

This project predicts the calories burnt by an individual based on various physiological and activity-related parameters using machine learning techniques in Python. The model employs a dataset containing features such as heart rate, duration of activity, and other relevant metrics.
The project encompasses thorough data exploration, preprocessing steps, and model evaluation, employing metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess performance.  

# Key Features:
- **Dataset:** Utilized a comprehensive dataset sourced from [mention dataset source if applicable].
- **Evaluation:** Evaluated model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- **Visualization:** Visualized the results and insights gained from the dataset using matplotlib and seaborn libraries.
- **Deployment:** Optionally, discuss any plans for deployment, like using Flask for creating an API or integrating it into a larger system.

#### Repository Structure:
- **Data:** Includes the dataset used for training and evaluation.
- **Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks detailing data exploration, preprocessing steps, model training, and evaluation.
- **Scripts:** Python scripts for model training and inference.
- **Documentation:** Readme file containing project description, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.
- **Results:** Visualizations and performance metrics showcasing the model's accuracy and effectiveness.
